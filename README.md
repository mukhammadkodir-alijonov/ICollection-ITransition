# ICollection-ITransition
 ICollection is a useful web platform designed for collectors that is created on asp.net MVC,
 .net 8 and PostgreSQL.

 Allows users to create collections,items and can like and comment.

# Implementations

Concrete classes implementing ICollection, providing various types of collections (e.g., lists, sets).
# Data Structures

Custom data structures that support the functionalities of ICollection and ITransition.
Examples include linked lists, dynamic arrays, and state machines.
# Algorithms

Algorithms for efficiently managing collections, such as sorting, searching, and iteration.
Transition algorithms for handling complex state changes and ensuring consistency.
# Key Features
Modular Design: The interfaces and their implementations are designed to be modular and easily extendable.
Efficiency: Emphasis on performance and efficiency in handling collections and state transitions.
Flexibility: Support for various types of collections and state transition models.
Documentation: Comprehensive documentation of interfaces, classes, and methods to facilitate understanding and usage.
