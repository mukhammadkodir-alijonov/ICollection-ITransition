#ICollection-ITransition
This repository contains the implementation of the ICollection and ITransition interfaces, along with their corresponding data structures and algorithms. These interfaces are designed to manage collections of items and handle transitions or state changes within these collections.

Repository Structure
#Interfaces

ICollection: Defines the methods for adding, removing, and retrieving items in a collection.
ITransition: Specifies the methods for handling state transitions of items within the collection.
#Implementations

Concrete classes implementing ICollection, providing various types of collections (e.g., lists, sets).
Classes implementing ITransition, managing the state changes of items.
#Data Structures

Custom data structures that support the functionalities of ICollection and ITransition.
Examples include linked lists, dynamic arrays, and state machines.
#Algorithms

Algorithms for efficiently managing collections, such as sorting, searching, and iteration.
Transition algorithms for handling complex state changes and ensuring consistency.
#Key Features
Modular Design: The interfaces and their implementations are designed to be modular and easily extendable.
Efficiency: Emphasis on performance and efficiency in handling collections and state transitions.
Flexibility: Support for various types of collections and state transition models.
Documentation: Comprehensive documentation of interfaces, classes, and methods to facilitate understanding and usage.
